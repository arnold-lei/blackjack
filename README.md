Welcome to my Black Jack App. It's still a work in progress but I think I have a really great start. 
I am currently having some trouble with application picking cards that have already been dealed. 
I will try to solve that ASAP

I'm starting to get lost in my own code. I think I need to get better at following pseudo code and thinking through the code as a whole.
I am falling deep into the rabbit hole. Hopefully with some practice it won't so frustrating. 
On more than one occasion I was tempted to delete the whole project and restart the project. I created a buglist to keep track of the things I need to rememebr to fix.
